Lists are very similar to arrays. 
They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish.
Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.
Example of how to build a list.



mylist = []
mylist.append(1)
mylist.append(2)
mylist.append(3)
print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
print(mylist[2]) # prints 3

# prints out 1,2,3
for x in mylist:
    print(x)



output:
1
2
3
1
2
3


Accessing an index which does not exist generates an exception (an error).

mylist = [1,2,3]
print(mylist[10])


problem:
add numbers and strings to the correct lists using the "append" list method.
 You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" list, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings variable.

You will also have to fill in the variable second_name with the second name in the names list, using the brackets operator [].
 Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.


numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]


numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)

strings.append("hello")
strings.append("world")

second_name = names[1]


print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)




output:

    [1, 2, 3]
    ['hello', 'world']
    The second name on the names list is Eric
